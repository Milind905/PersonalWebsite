		<h1>Hey, I'm Milind</h1>
		<!-- Add some sort of section indicator-->
		<p>I'm an aspiring software developer currently studying computer engineering at the <span>University of Waterloo</span>. I've had a passion for computers that has been exponentially increasing the more I work with them! My career as a programmer began during my first internship at <span>Scotiabank </span> and has continued growing while working for the <span>Department of National Defense</span>. I was able to take my skills to the next level while interning at <span>FlashStock</span>. And most recently, I was able to refine these skills at <span>Intentional Software Corporation</span>. When I'm not programming, I'll most likely be playing the beautiful game that is Starcraft, reading an immersive science fiction book, climbing exciting routes at a bouldering gym, or running out of breath at a marathon.
